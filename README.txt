Having little privacy and anonymity in modern society is a vast problem as our digital traits exist everywhere. Additionally, because we are incorporating technology more and more into our daily life, it is becoming harder to leave fewer digital traits that you don't want to be public. However, the technological evolution toward a different direction means to be secure about controlling your data flow. You should have an excellent knowledge of Computer Science to take it under your control. As a result, the group of people who are more aware and better understand

this procedure is safer, but the others are more vulnerable. There are also some possibilities that subjects that have access to the server have extraordinary abilities to gain or manipulate the data. They can also affect the population's decision by intervening in some technological procedure for subjective reasons. Blockchain is the technology that provides us with a system that provides us with secure, private, and safe interoperability.

Considering the issues mentioned, the designed and implemented multi-chain services that consider identification based on Smart Contracts of Blockchain technology are opening the way for new technology that considers private, secure, and safe from interactions outside the system. The project's main objective is to build a multi-chain token for issuing, getting, and confirming computerized credentials. The token will guarantee a decentralized environment to the extent where no central subjects are involved; rather, everybody who is a portion of the venture community contains a right to vote for the future of the project.

Hence, I will create five digital currencies containing 10 million tokens each that will be later used in testing and validation of E-governance services. This system will solve the issues mentioned above of a centralized system and provide a safer and more stable system at the base of Ethereum.
